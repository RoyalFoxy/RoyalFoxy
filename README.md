# Welcome!

I see you have gotten to my profile. Take a seat and just feel like home.

# About me

I'm from Switzerland and a young adult. I work as a web developer, fullstack, but I love to do things outside of my work spectrum too. I also have a [website](https://royalfoxy.xyz) that details some more stuff!

# What you can expect

I will mostly have private repos for configs and stuff but I have been working on some npm packages like `keyboard-menu`. Check it out!
